You can build, run, and test the targets using the following Bazel commands:

```bash
# A library that build successfully
bazel build //src/build:build_compiling

# A library that fails to build
bazel build //src/build:build_not_compiling

# A target that takes infinitely long time to build
bazel build //src/build:build_infinite_loop

# A target that uses generated code (which is generated by another target)
#  and builds successfully. Before building this target, 
#  code intelligence will be broken.
bazel build //src/build:build_uses_generated_code

# A binary that runs successfully
bazel run //src/binary:run_sample

# A binary that takes infinitely long time to run
bazel run //src/binary:run_infinite_loop

# A test that runs successfully
bazel test //src/test:test_passing

# A test that fails
bazel test //src/test:test_failing

# A test that takes infinitely long time to run
bazel test //src/test:test_infinite_loop
```
